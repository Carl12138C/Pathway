[Original Idea Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12T0b-e87_eChFAIsiES9U5QxapTsxlRZ/edit)

## Proposal

Pathway is a financial assistant app for college students who wish to improve their financial literacy and make informed decisions about their money. Pathway allows users to track their income and manage their expenses to achieve their financial goals. With a streamlined design, our app is solely dedicated to empowering our users to make smart decisions about their money, using only the information authorized to us by the user.

## Audience / Persona

Pathway is aimed at college students who are struggling with their finances.

Here are some examples of users who may use our app:

 Sarah is a busy college student who enjoys her daily coffee. However, she has recently felt that her coffee spending has been cutting into her ability to afford healthy and balanced meals. With Pathway, Sarah can easily track how much she spends on food and coffee each week, and make adjustments accordingly.

 Jack is a dedicated art student who likes to experiment with different types of mediums. Whenever he has a big new project in mind, Jack can use Pathway to track his expenses and save for materials and supplies needed for his next masterpiece.
